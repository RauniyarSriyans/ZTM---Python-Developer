# Server 

1. Setup a virtual environment using the command: python -m venv venv before starting a project. 
2. Activate the virtual environment using the command:. venv\bin\activate
3. For Flask, set up a flask app using the command: export FLASK_APP=server.py --> or name of the file where the app is located.
4. Set up the environment to development mode using the command: export FLASK_ENV=development --> this will allow the server to 
reload automatically when changes are made to the code.
5. Run the server using the command: flask run 

# Rendering templates 

1. Flask has a built-in module called render_template which is used to render templates.
2. This render_template module seeks templates in the templates folder. --> Always have a templates folder and move all your html 
files there. 
3. All CSS and Javascript files should be in a static folder.
4. A favicon.ico file should be in the static folder. It's an icon that appears on the tab of the browser. To add a favicon to your 
web app, just add this to your HTML head tag:
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='favicon.ico') }}">
5. To ensure template, add Python expressions inside the HTML file using the {{ }} syntax. This tells Flask to render the expression
inside the curly braces.
