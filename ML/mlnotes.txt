# Machine Learning

1. All starts with AI --> Machine Learning is a subset of AI --> Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning
   Data Science intersects with Machine Learning, AI, and Deep Learning all. 
2. Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
3. Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden 
insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.
4. Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to make and improve predictions or behaviors based on some data.

# Types of Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning - The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, and the algorithm learns to predict the output from 
the input data.
Eg: Classification, Regression
2. Unsupervised Learning - The algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, and the algorithm learns to predict the output. 
Eg: Clustering, Association
3. Reinforcement Learning - The algorithm learns to perform an action based on the feedback from the environment.
Eg: Game playing, Robotics

# Steps in Machine Learning
1. Import the data / Data Collection - The data can be in any format like CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.
2. Clean the data - The data may contain missing values, duplicate values, etc.
3. Split the data - The data is split into training and testing data.
4. Train the model - The model is trained on the training data.
5. Test the model - The model is tested on the testing data.
6. Improve the model - The model is improved based on the testing data.

# Tools in Machine Learning
1. Python - Python is the most popular language for machine learning.
NumPy --> NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays 
and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Pandas --> Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library
built on top of the Python programming language.
Matplotlib --> Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
Seaborn --> Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
Scikit-learn --> Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
TensorFlow --> TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks.
Keras --> Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.
PyTorch --> PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library.
